## Hey there!

I'm Aiden, a student at Imperial College London studying a Masters of Science in Risk Management & Financial Engineering.

I am currently learning Python and C++ with a focus on their use in Finance.

Currently, I am working on implementing the theoretical concepts I have learnt at Imperial into code, to further develop my understanding of how theoretical concepts are applied in practice.
